<b>Team: Solo</b>
<p>The demon does not belong on any team and seeks to kill every other player, villager and wolf alike.</p>
<p>Each night, the demon gets to kill a person of their choosing. Any player who targets the demon at night will immediately die. The only way the demon can be killed is by a day-time vote.</p>
