<p>In its simplest form Wolf is played by two teams: the Werewolves, whose members know each other's identity, and the innocents (a.k.a. "civilians," "townspeople," "village," "town," etc.), who at first know only the number of wolves in the game.</p>
<p>There are two phases: "night," when the wolves may eliminate a player from the game, and "day," during which players vote to kill a suspect. These phases follow each other continuously until all wolves have been eliminated or the wolves outnumbers the innocents.</p>
