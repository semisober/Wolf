<b>Team Village</b>
<p>While the villager is the most common role, it is also one of the most important. As a villager, you should be investigating the other players, asking them questions, and forming theories.</p>
<p>Unlike roles like the seer and the priest, you don't have to worry as much about getting killed and can risk more in your endeavours to uncover the evil that lurks in our village.</p>
