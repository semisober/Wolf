<b>Team Village</b>
<p>Each night, the priest can protect a person of their choosing. A protected person that is targeted to be killed by the wolves will not die.</p>
<p>A good priest will try to make sure that the seer is protected and will try to predict which targets the wolves will go after in the night.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> By default, a priest cannot protect the same player two nights in a row!</p>
