<p>Each night, the seer is able to focus on a person and determine whether they are a wolf or a villager.</p>
<p>An important part of playing the seer is determining when to "come out" as the seer. When you tell everyone you are the seer, you can reveal your useful information, but you make yourself a target for the wolves.</p>
